## Team My Hand
People who suffer from Parkinsonâ€™s Disease or naturally shaky hands have a difficult time gripping objects with their fingers and hands. This makes it difficult to perform basic, everyday tasks such as eating.

Our proposed solution is to make a robotic arm that will mimic the arm and hand motions associated with bringing food from a dish to the mouth.
